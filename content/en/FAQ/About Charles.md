## **What is Charles?**

CharlesCD is an open-source tool that makes more agile, safe, and continuous deployment, which allows development teams to validate their hypothesis with specific groups of users, simultaneously.

## **What is a circle deploy?**

The circle deployment is Charles' concept. It's possible to deploy the same application with different segmentations of users at the same time.

## **What is the main difference in Charles?**

Charles allows developers to perform segmentation and group users with circles simultaneously,  it is a different way of deployment. 

The delivery process in traditional environments occurs weekly, biweekly, or even monthly -  and with Charles, it gains a new rhythm. The feedback cycle of your product becomes faster and effective, which means you can manage your timing in a more assertive way. â€Œ

Developers will be more encouraged to innovate and implement new versions because identifying bugs will be easier and creating circles helps minimize budget errors.
