  In this section, you will find more information about how to set up your
  metrics using Charles.

Charles' metrics configuration is performed on Istio and on your own metrics provider. See more details below. 

## Istio Configuration

Metrics related to circle requests are quantified and exposed by Istio, so it's necessary to configure it to get information about each circle.

{{% alert color="danger" %}}
The configuration in this section can be done starting with Istio =&gt;1.7 versions.

## Configuring your metrics' tool

After you finish your Istio configuration it is necessary to configure your metrics tool.

See below the details of the tools Charles will be able to read.

{{< tabs name="T0" >}}
{{% tab name="Prometheus" %}}
Prometheus is an open-source system for monitoring and alerting toolkit. It is the main monitoring recommendation on [**Cloud Native Computing Foundation**](https://cncf.io/)

In order for Prometheus to be able to read and store metrics data, you have to configure it.

To do so, it's necessary to add the job below so it will read Istio's generated metrics. Just configure by editing the **prometheus.yml** file into your **Prometheus configMap**.

It is important to remember that all these configurations consider that your Prometheus is on the same Kubernetes cluster as your Istio and the rest of your applications.

### Metadata

â€ŒEach metric has a metadata range that allows a variety of filter and analysis types to be created. More metadata was added to Istio and you can see them described in the table below:

| Metadata | Description | Type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| destination\_component | Value on the label 'app' of the pod that received the request or unknown if there is no information about it. | Text |
| circle\_source | Circle label injected into any Kubernetes pods. | Text |
| response\_code | HTTP status of the response. | Numeric |

{{% tab name="Google Analytics" %}}
Google Analytics is one of the data sources that Charles can connect to read your metrics. 

To be able to use in your metrics group, you will need

* A Google account and the Analytics configured.

If you want to use Charles to analyze your Google Analytics data, you need to add a new metric with your circle ID \(**renaming it as circle\_source**\) in your metrics label.
