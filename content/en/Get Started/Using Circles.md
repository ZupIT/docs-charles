From the moment you start to create your deploys, the next step is to [**create your first circles**](/reference/circles/) to make your application segmentation better.

Follow the next steps:

{{% alert color="info" %}}
Before you follow the steps, make sure you have already installed and configured [**Circle Matcher**]({{< ref path="/Reference/Circle Matcher.md" lang="en">}}) on your [**workspace**]({{< ref path="/Get Started/Defining a Workspace/Overview.md" lang="en">}})
{{% /alert %}}

1. [**Create your circle**]({{< ref path="/Reference/Circles.md" lang="en">}});
2. Use circle matcher to verify if the logic rules created for the segmentation are correctly identifying the users.
3. Make your deployment on the circle created before.
