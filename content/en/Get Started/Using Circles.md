From the moment you start to create your deploys, the next step is to [**create you first circles**](../../../../../reference/circles#how-to-create-circles) to make your applications segmentation better.

Follow the next steps:

{{% alert color="info" %}}
Before you follow the steps, make sure you have already installed and configured [**Circle Matcher**](../../../reference/circle-matcher) on your [**workspace**__](defining-a-workspace/)__
{{% /alert %}}

1. [**Create your circle**](../reference/circles#how-to-create-circles);
2. Use circle matcher to verify if the logic rules created for the segmentation are correctly identifying the users.
3. Make your deploy on the circle created before.
