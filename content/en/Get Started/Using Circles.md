From the moment you start to create your deploys, the next step is to [**create you first circles**](/reference/circles/) to make your applications segmentation better.

Follow the next steps:

{{% alert color="info" %}}
Before you follow the steps, make sure you have already installed and configured [**Circle Matcher**](/reference/circle-matcher/) on your [**workspace**](/get-started/defining-a-workspace/overview/)
{{% /alert %}}

1. [**Create your circle**](/reference/circles/);
2. Use circle matcher to verify if the logic rules created for the segmentation are correctly identifying the users.
3. Make your deploy on the circle created before.
